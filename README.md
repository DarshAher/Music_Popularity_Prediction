**🎵 Predicting Music Popularity with Machine Learning — A Hands-On Guide**

Have you ever wondered what makes a song popular? Is it the tempo, the danceability, or maybe the artist’s style? In this article, we’ll explore how to use machine learning to predict the popularity of music tracks based on their audio features.

Whether you're curious about data science or passionate about music, this project is a great way to combine both worlds. By the end, you’ll have a working ML model that can estimate how popular a track might become — and maybe even help streaming platforms fine-tune their playlists and recommendations.

### 🔍 What Is Music Popularity Prediction?

Music popularity prediction is all about building a machine learning model that uses audio features and metadata to estimate how well a song will perform — think streams, downloads, or even chart rankings. It typically involves **regression techniques** to forecast popularity scores.

This type of analysis can be incredibly valuable for music producers, artists, and marketing teams looking to make data-driven decisions about what tracks to promote.

### 🧠 Let’s Build It Together

To get started, we need a dataset — and I’ve got just the one. It contains **227 music tracks**, each with detailed features like tempo, energy, loudness, and more. It also includes metadata such as the track name, artist, album, and release date.

We’ll walk through how to clean the data, engineer features, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance — all using **Python**.
